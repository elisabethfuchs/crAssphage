# All Sequences We Found From Everywhere

This data set includes all the sequences that we found from everywhere regardless of the metadata.

To make this, `cd` into the appropriate directory, e.g. PrimerA, and then copy the symbolic links from [../../Sequences/PrimerA](../../Sequences/PrimerA) using the `cp -d` command that preserves symbolic links. Then you just need to add/remove links as appropriate. The main one to look at is the link from the metagenomes.
