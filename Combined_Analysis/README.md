# Combined Analysis

This directory contains a combined analysis of all samples that contain country information. We have merged them into a single file and assembled them all together.

The directory [Analysis](Analysis) contains all the sequences that have locality information, whereas the directory [AllAnalysis](AllAnalysis) contains _all_ the sequence data. We based the analysis in the paper on the [Analysis](Analysis) folder since we do statistics on the metadata including the location of the sample. The  [AllAnalysis](AllAnalysis) data was used to identify the most abundant sequence.

The [Sequences](Sequences) folder contains links to the sequences for the [Analysis](Analysis) folder. The  [AllSequences](AllSequences) folder contains the links to the sequences used in the [AllAnalysis](AllAnalysis) folder.

[country_counts.tsv](country_counts.tsv) has a count of all the instances of primers A, B, and C from each country
