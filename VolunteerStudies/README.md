# Volunteer Studies

Several people were kind enough to provide samples for us to test for crAssphage. Holly Norman and Maria Ohaeri tested all the samples by PCR, and sequenced those samples that were positive for crAssphage.

The [sequence information](SequenceInformation.md) page contains more information about the sequences, including the metadata for each of the reads (including the volunteer ID, sample number, etc). 

The [Sequences](Sequences) directory contains the raw data, including the .ab1 files, and the processed data that was aligned.

The [Analysis](Analysis) directory contains the analyzed data including the trees.
