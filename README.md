# Updated data:

Please take a look at [Kyle Levi's fork](https://github.com/KyleLevi/crAssphage) of this repository. He has more data that will eventually be merged here.

# crAssphage

Sequencing and analysis of crAssphage regions from around the globe

This is a repository of DNA sequences, analysis, and other information for the global crAssphage project. 
We have developed this site as a common resource for everyone to add sequences, get sequences from, and build 
alignments and analyses. If you want to become a collaborator and add data to the repository, please contact Rob 
Edwards. If you want to just take the data and analyze it, you can clone this whole data set using `git clone 
https://github.com/linsalrob/crAssphage.git`.

All of the data here is provided under the MIT License. Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you 
include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software, source code, data, or other parts
of the repository.

If you use this data or analysis please let Rob know. 

Please be aware that Rob and our collaborators are working on a manuscript describing this data, and so please do
not use this data as part of a manuscript without asking Rob. We will almost certainly say *yes*, unless you are
writing exactly the same manuscript that we are writing, and in which case we'll invite you to join our team!

*Do the right thing!*

# crAssphage sequences

## Genbank Sequence

The original sequence that was published in Genbank (but has [since been deleted](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JQ995537)) is available as [JQ995537.gbk](JQ995537.gbk). It should be available in [RefSeq](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/674660337) although that comes and goes sometimes.

## Sequences

We have received sequences from the Netherlans, France, Israel, Denmark, and Ireland. We are still looking for more collaborators to provide sequences. Some sites have reported not finding any crAssphage, but not many!
 
[Sequences](Sequences) are provided by our [collaborators](COLLABORATORS.md)

## Analysis

We have started a preliminary [analysis](Analysis) of the data. You can download the sequences and run your own analysis too, we'd love to know what you try and how it works.
