# Assembled Sequences

The sequences were independently assembled with cap3, spades, and newbler. Cap3 gave lots of short assemblies, spades mostly could not complete the assemblies because of k-mer counting issues trying to assemble short fragments, and newbler gave the most longer assemblies. However, we also have haplotype data from gretel in the [haplotype](../Haplotypes) folder, and you should use those.

The haplotype data has appropriate length sequences, and does not collapse indels in the assembly process.
