# Data from Ondrej Cinek group

This is all the data from the Cinek group.

### Africa and Asia

There are (currently) two repositories for the Africa and Asia data:
* [Africa_Asia_Orginal](Africa_Asia_Orginal) only has the email from 4/20/17. We only have the processed fasta files for this analysis currently
* [Africa_Asia_Revised](Africa_Asia_Revised) has the data that was shared on 9/15/17 and that is included in the analysis.

The revised data is from ABI chromatograms of individuals (mostly children). See the [readme](Africa_Asia_Revised/README.md) for more information about those samples.
