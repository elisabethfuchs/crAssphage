# Data from Africa and Asia

Email 4/20/17

Karla has finished Sanger sequencing of the African and Asian crassphages we had. Some have a decent signal, some are weaker, and some simply dropped out.

This is a study on bacteriome and virome upon type 1 diabetes onset in non-European non American populations: the total count of samples is 178 (51 Azerbaijan, 40 Jordan, 28 Nigeria, 59 Sudan). As the diabetes is new, it could hardly influence the occurrence of Crassphage. All subjects are children.

Those for sequencing were identified by assessing viromes for hit to the reference CrAssphage genome; please see the excel table. There were 39 such samples - many rather strong.

Karla attempted Sanger sequencing of all three segments, with 45 cycle amplification from the same DNA/RNA as was prepared for virome sequencing.

The results are sent as
    (a) fasta of alignments (CrAssA.fasta, CrAssB.fasta, CrAssC.fasta)
    (b) a pack of Geneious 7 data (CrAssA afrika.geneious)
    (c) gel photos (pls see the gels directory, but do not put them on-line, these are really ugly photos)
    (d) ab1 files from the sequencer.

If you find these useful, we will have to add a couple of authors, as the samples were extremely difficult to collect.

These are the processed fasta files for those sequences
