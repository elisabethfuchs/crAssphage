# Samples from Czech sewage waters

Email 3/24/16

I would like to inform you about final sequencing of crAssphage in Czech sewage waters. 
Sequences of crAssphage in option A, B and C are quite different. Some of them are long and expecially sequences in option C are very short. 
We would be pleased if you check our results. What is your opinion? Which sequences seems good and which are necessary to remake? 
We are looking forward to your answer.

# Sequences

These sequences are included in [CZ_A.20151201.fasta](../../../PrimerA/CZ_A.20151201.fasta),  [CZ_B.20151201.fasta](../../../PrimerB/CZ_B.20151201.fasta), and [CZ_C.20151201.fasta](../../../PrimerC/CZ_C.20151201.fasta) 

# Short sequences

A few of these sequences are short and divergent. See the blast results files [cz.A.blastn](cz.A.blastn), [cz.B.blastn](cz.B.blastn), and [cz.C.blastn](cz.C.blastn) and were removed from the analysis (although they remain here if we want to include them).
