# Data from Finland

Email dated: 11/15/15

Here they are: plain Fasta, gb, and geneious format. All contain the same samples, plus a NC_024711.1 reference to which they have been actually aligned.

I cannot share the individual data on the samples (e.g. place of collection, age etc) as I do not have the permission - this will be obtained shortly. Now they are identified by a sequencing bin only which can later be linked to clinical data.

They are part of a paper  Kramná L, Kolářová K, Oikarinen S, Pursiheimo JP, Ilonen J, Simell O, Knip M, Veijola R, Hyöty H, Cinek O. Gut virome sequencing in children with early islet autoimmunity. Diabetes Care. 2015 May;38(5):930-3. [here is the paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25678103)

and the reads have been posted publicly on SRA as PRJNA275568.

All are from individual stool samples from Finnish children from a cohort at genetic risk of type 1 diabetes. Two more were positive but the alignment was full of long gaps and poorly covered.
  
In the next e-mail I am sending the sam file showing the actual composition of these alignments.

# Note:

These metagenomes have been included in the metagenome analysis.  Therefore, the data that was originally included in _PrimerA/Cinek\_A.20151120.fasta_ and _PrimerB/Cinek\_B.20151120.fasta_ and _PrimerC/Cinek\_C.20151120.fasta_ has been removed. It is kept here in case we decide to put it back.

There are 96 runs in PRJNA275568 as listed on the SRA website and in [PRJNA275568.acc](PRJNA275568.acc). All of these are being compared to crAssphage to ensure that crAss-positive samples are included.
