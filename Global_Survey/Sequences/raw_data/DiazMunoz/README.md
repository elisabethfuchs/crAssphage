# Data from Sam Diaz Munoz and Collaborators

This data was provided by Sam Diaz Munoz, Kristen Gulino, Alan Twaddle, and Elodie Ghedin.

For detailed description of the samples, please take a look at [the PDF report](diazmunoz_etal_crAssphage_report.pdf) that Sam provided.

There are three primary sequences we have included in the analysis:

* NYC - these samples were collected from 14 locations around New York City and pooled. The details of the sampling are provided in [the PDF report](diazmunoz_etal_crAssphage_report.pdf). The location that is reported for these sequences is the geographic center of the samples.
* Davis 1 - A one liter sample was collected from the City of Davis WWTP on April 21, 2016 and two 5 ml aliquots were prepared. The two Davis samples are from these two aliquots.
* Davis 3

Note also that Sam Diaz Munoz attempted to collect samples from San Juan, Puerto Rico, but was unable to amplify any crAssphage from those samples.
